*Currently, Jacob’s Ph.D. project focuses on the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary drivers of center-periphery dynamics in endemic plants. He is particularly interested in understanding how endemic plant differential investment in herbivory defense, pollinators, and dispersers attraction, and changes in herbivory pressure, plant-soil feedback and frequency dependence of pollinators and dispersers can explain weak population dynamics at the edge of species distribution range. This work includes conducting manipulative and common garden experiments, collecting field demographic studies, and developing mathematical models. Jacob’s career goal is to have a broad-based academic career combining teaching, research, and conservation work. The ultimate goal of the research is to communicate to stakeholders sustainable use strategies and conservation actions needed to ensure the viability of endangered plant species.*
