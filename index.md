title: "About me"
---
*I am a postdoctoral research associate in Dr. Tom Millerâ€™s lab at the Department of Bioscience, Rice University.* 
My research revolves around understanding the mechanisms underlying species range limitation. I use manipulative and common garden experiments, field demographic studies, and mathematical models to uncover these mechanisms. 
I am also interested in understanding why and how local people select plants in the tropics.
