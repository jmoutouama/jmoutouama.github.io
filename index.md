title: "About me"
---
I am a postdoctoral research associate in Dr. Tom Miller’s <a href="https://miller-lab-ecology.weebly.com" target="_blank">lab</a> at <a href="https://www.rice.edu" target="_blank">Rice University</a>, USA.

My research revolves around understanding the mechanisms underlying species range limitation. I use manipulative and common garden experiments, field demographic studies, and mathematical models to uncover these mechanisms. 
I am also interested in understanding why and how local people select plants in the tropics.
